                <p>Dheem Tana is the University of California Davis Annual Indian Classical Dance Competition. Our goal is to provide a platform for Indian Classical Dance teams to showcase their talent and passion for dance in a positive atmosphere, where dancers can meet and form bonds with others who share the same goals and interests. Davis Dheem Tana is hosted in partnership with Visions at UC Davis, a charity organization focused on the education of underprivileged children in India, Sri Lanka, and Ethiopia. Davis warmly welcomes you to its third annual Indian classical dance event, Davis Dheem Tana 2017! </p>
